# MLOps-Basics

 > There is nothing magic about magic. The magician merely understands something simple which doesn’t appear to be simple or natural to the untrained audience. Once you learn how to hold a card while making your hand look empty, you only need practice before you, too, can “do magic.” – Jeffrey Friedl in the book Mastering Regular Expressions

The goal of the series is to understand the basics of MLOps like model building, monitoring, configurations, testing, packaging, deployment, cicd, etc.

Refer to the [Blog Post here](https://www.ravirajag.dev/blog/mlops-project-setup-part1)

The project I have implemented is a simple classification problem. The scope of this week is to understand the following topics:

- `How to get the data?`
- `How to process the data?`
- `How to define dataloaders?`
- `How to declare the model?`
- `How to train the model?`
- `How to do the inference?`

Following tech stack is used:

- `Huggingface Datasets`
- `Huggingface Transformers`
- `Pytorch Lightning`
